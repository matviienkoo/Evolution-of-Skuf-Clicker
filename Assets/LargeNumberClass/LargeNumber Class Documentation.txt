This asset is a single script. It is for handling very large numbers for clicker and other types of games. It can go to numbers as high as 999.999.. Quadragintillion (10^123 decimal places).

I made the numbers in increments of 3 digit segments for the large number naming convention of the short scale used by US, Canada and modern British.

The large number class does not derive from monobehaviour so to create one you do it with the new keyword.
LargeNumber largeNumber=new LargeNumber();

There are 3 contructors, one with no arguments, one with 1 argument and one with 2 arguments.

LargeNumber largeNumber = new LargeNumber();
Creates a Lage number that equals 0.

LargeNumber largeNumber = new LargeNumber(x);
Creates a Lage number that equals x, where x equals 0-999, numbers lager than 999 will result in 999.
LargeNumber largeNumberOneHundred = new LargeNumber(100);
Creates a Lage number that equals 100.

LargeNumber largeNumber = new LargeNumber(x,y);
Creates a Lage number where x equals 0-999, values for x lager than 999 will result in 999, with y*3 zeros after it, values for y over 41 is passed it will become 41. Because the numbers are divided into segments of 3 you need to divided the decimal places by 3 if you want to specify a particular number, so the maximum value for the second parameter is 41 which is 1 Quadragintillion or 10^123.
LargeNumber largeNumberTwentyDuodecillion = new LargeNumber(20,13);
20 with 13*3 or 39 zeros after it.


Helper methods

I created methods for assign and equals rather than over load the = and == operators.
public void Assign(LargeNumber p_num) //assigns the value of one large number to another
public int Equals(LargeNumber p_compare) //comapares 2 large numbers returning 0 for equal 1 if p_compare is less, -1 if p_compare is more

public void AddOne()
public void SubOne()
public void AddLargeNumber(LargeNumber p_amount)
public void SubLargeNumber(LargeNumber p_amount)
public string LargeNumberToString() //converts the Large number into a string
public string LargeNumberToShortString() //converts the Large number into a string int the format of 374.473 million.

There are other methods that work behind the scenes you will not need to use.
